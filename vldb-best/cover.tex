\title{DBSP: Automatic Incremental View Maintenance for Rich Query
  Languages}

\maketitle

This paper is an extended version of a VLDB 2023
publication~\cite{budiu-vldb23}, adopting the notations
from~\cite{budiu-sigmod24}; all the diagrams have been redrawn with
this notation.  The major changes are: adding new incremental program
examples (Sections 5.2, 6.1), an significantly expanded implementation
in Section~7, and an experimental evaluation in Section~8.  The
related work section has also been expanded.

Many more people were involved in the implementation, so the author
list has been expanded.  All the original paper authors are included
in the current list of authors.
