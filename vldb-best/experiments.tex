\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}

We provide results for microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks with our
implementation of DBSP.

Both kinds of benchmarks focus on performance in
Nexmark~\cite{tucker2008nexmark}, which specifies a synthetic data
stream generation scheme for an online auction site along with a suite
of queries against the streams.  Nexmark is a natural choice for
evaluating DBSP because it is already implemented for other streaming
database systems, notably for Flink~\cite{carbone-ieee15,
  nexmark-flink}, a widely used stream processing system.

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

Desired microbenchmarks:

\begin{itemize}
\item Time to insert or delete a tuple given various operators
  (especially ones that require integration).  We might be able to use
  some of the Nexmark queries, or write simple ones.

\item Batch size performance, like the memory experiment
  \url{https://github.com/feldera/feldera/discussions/2314#discussioncomment-10433354}.

\item Storage engine performance like
  \url{https://www.feldera.com/blog/feldera-storage/}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Macrobenchmarks}
