\section{Experimental Evaluation}\label{sec:experiments}

Desired evaluation:

\begin{itemize}
\item Microbenchmarks, such as time to insert or delete a tuple given
  various operators (especially ones that require integration).

\item Batch size performance, like the memory experiment
  \url{https://github.com/feldera/feldera/discussions/2314#discussioncomment-10433354}.

\item Macrobenchmark comparison against Flink like
  \url{https://www.feldera.com/blog/nexmark-vs-flink/}.

\item Storage engine performance like
  \url{https://www.feldera.com/blog/feldera-storage/}.
\end{itemize}
